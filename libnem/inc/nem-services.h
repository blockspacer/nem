// This file describes service/command ids. These are basically hardcoded
// everywhere rather than passing strings. It might make more sense to pass
// strings, but those can be stuffed into the headers under a specified 
// "use strings instead" service. Anyway it's easier parsing/dispatching on
// the C side if these are just integers.

// This is the master list of services that can be provided by daemons. These
// are stuffed into NEM_pmsg_t.service_id and indicate which service type should
// be targetted.
